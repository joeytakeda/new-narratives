            <p>As philosophers have started becoming interested in the
                works of women philosophers, slowly modern editions of works
                of some women have begun appearing in print. We've been
                helped by the interest in women's philosophical writings by
                literary scholars of the period. But there are many women
                whose works remain largely unexplored, in part because of
                the inaccessibility of the works.</p>

            <p>This collectively produced open-source bibliography aims to
                pool our collective knowledge, about who wrote what, when,
                and where and how to find it now.</p>

            <p>This bibliography will make it a more straightforward matter
                to begin research projects on early modern women
                philosophers. Through the bibliography, both researchers and
                their students can find names of published authors whose
                works have long been neglected, their works, and a start at
                how to access those works.</p>

            <p>This bibliography tracks the preparation of modern and
                digital editions, with particular attention to the form and
                location of digital editions. With the rediscovery of women
                philosophers and their works, scholars have been invested in
                making long out-of-print works more accessible. In some
                cases, modern scholarly editions have been published. In
                other cases, digital editions have been prepared. But there
                is still lots more work to do. We want to ensure resources
                are used wisely and work is not duplicated.</p>

            <p>This bibliography tracks details that can have big impact in
                tracing lines of influence. The bibliography records each
                edition of a work, and has room for notes about important
                differences in the editions. Multiple printings suggest that
                a work was widely read over the period of the printing of
                the editions. The bibliography also records whether a
                particular edition was translated, and into which languages.
                Translation into other languages implies a broad impact. The
                bibliography also can track individuals to whom works are
                dedicated and who wrote prefaces. These details can help to
                identify nodes of research networks, and so to more easily
                find other neglected authors of the period. </p>
